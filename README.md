# first-unity-game
fox platform game!

this is my first attempt at making a unity game and first time using c#!
this was created in the summer of 2020 but posted on april 1, 2021 (not a joke)

i used a video tutorial for this on youtube but did not copy and paste any code and used some of my own methods of solving some problems needed to be solved.
